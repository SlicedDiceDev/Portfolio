          <h1>What Is Handle Of The Realms?</h1>
          
            <p>
              A solo Narrative and Level Design 15 week project across the months of January - May 2025 in Unreal 5.4 inspired by 
              Greek Mythology. The player takes the role of a more cecent child of the elder Titan Kronos, who's sole purpose in 
              this world was to be the catalyst for the rule of titans. In this experience, the war of Titan's and God's has come 
              and gone, leaving the player to search through their memories for assistance in their journey.
          </p>

          <h1>My Process</h1>

              <p>
                The early stages of the project had consisted of making early documentation and roadmapping to help pave the way
                through an intependent project. My structure for the roadmap helped develop my MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of:
                6 Narrative Artifcats achieved by interacting with NPC's that allow the player to learn more about this world.
                This MVP has adapted over the course of the semester, but has remained true for the most important parts.

          <p>
            I initially had followed the dual-development process of developing both art assets and reworking the narrative
            system at the same time. While this had allowed for even development across multiple disciplines, this ended up
            taking away from the more tedious system development that would scope creep later in development. However, this work
            style had allowed for all necessary art assets to be made at a functional in the first few weeks.

          </div>

          <p>
            The narrative system is adapted from Master Dinochan: Dialogue Tree and Quest System. Using the features from this
            system, I was able to create interactive quest lines that allow for progression through dialogue choises. This system
            allows for the player to view what the quest details are in relation to each NPC, which is based off of different Greek
            Gods. These quests are tied directly to what their role would be during the flashback time period these events are from.
          </p>

          <div>
            <img src="./images/CJfinished1.png" class="right-text-image" style="width:30%">
          </div>

          <p>
            Initially the plan for the quest lines for the gods were to be structured as "walk and talk" quests. The idea behind
            these is that the player would be able to walk along side each NPC during their quest and communicate through
            predetermiend dialogue. Though through rescoping issues, this was changed to there being 2 environments that house 3
            God NPC's each. This restructuring allowed me more time to continue developing the interactive quest system.
          </p>

            <img src="./images/CJfinished1.png" class="right-text-image" style="width:30%">
          </div>

          <p>
            The final product of this project was set to being more of a proof of concept for the interactive dialogue quest
            working. After having to make cuts due to rescoping, having 6 unique interactive dialogue quests with 2 detailed
            greyboxed environments I feel was enough to help grow my experience in both of my desiered sub-disciplines.
