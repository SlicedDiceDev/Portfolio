              <h1>What Is Solanis?</h1>
              
                <p>
                    This flight game takes place in a dark fantasy post-apocalyptic world, 1000 years after the death of the gods. The player takes on the role of the Accipitera, 
                    sworn protector of Lady Moon, the god of the night, agriculture, and guardian of the realm of the gods. 1000 years ago, the moon was torn from the sky and 
                    trapped inside the PC, buried underground as the rest of the gods fled or were killed. Now, in the aftermath of the thousand years of sun and terrible magics 
                    and creatures flooding the land, the Accipitera has reemerged to bring the fragments of the moon back together and return it to the sky, ending the apocalypse.

              <h1>My Process</h1>

                  <p>
                    As someone who was onboarded halfway through development, my goal early on was to create a strong foundation through documentation for future narrative development.
                    The goal of this process was to allow for all parts of the team to use the documentation I created to allow for full team creative synergy.
                  </p>
              </div>    
              <div>
                <img src="./images/styleguide.JPG" class="right-text-image" style="width:30%">
  
              <p>
                To help unify writing styles across the writing and narrative team, I created a document specifically for character style guides. This way we would have consistant writing styles
                across the narrative team, spanning multiple unique characters. The importance of these style guides was to ensure that they could also be digested by our future voice actors.
              </p>
            </div>
              <div>
                <img src="./images/linesfull.JPG" class="right-text-image" style="width: 30%">
              </div>
  
              <p>
                Our first 8 weeks of production leading up to our "Alpha Lock" was also dubbed "Script Lock" by the narrative team. Knowing this, we had written and edited 600+
                lines of dialogue ready to be voice acted. These lines spanned across 4 speaking NPC's that all have their own unique tones and event based dialogue sequencing.
              </p>
  
              <div>
                <img src="./images/inkypoi.JPG" class="right-text-image" style="width:30%">
              </div>
  
              <p>
                I was in charge of writing not only the dialogue from our main NPC talking to the player about important landmarks in the world to continue with world building,
                but a secondary NPC that the player was able to directly interact with. My goal through these characters creations and writing out the world expansion was to further
                immerse the player in a story rich yet desolate world.
              </p>
  
              <div>
                <img src="./images/solanisblueprint.JPG" class="right-text-image" style="width:30%">
              </div>
  
              <p>
                Moving into our "Beta Lock", the narrative and sound team had started meeting with our chosen voice actors to start recording dialogue. From this point on we had been working on
                implementing and hard cutting lines that were linked to voice lines. This way we could still have a fun narrative experience while not overwhelming the player.
