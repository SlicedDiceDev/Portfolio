            <h3>Ruins</h3>
            <a href="./ruins.html">Ruins</a>
            <p>
              A map based on the design elements seen in Riot Games: VALORANT that would have its own unique twist 
              while incorporating the same principles that are seen across all of their maps. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The intent of RUINS is to give players a new map to explore that feels similar to all previous maps, 
              but still provide a learning experience that helps separate this map from the others with its own uniqueness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the lore in VALORANT with new maps being discovered based on a hidden deposit of their fictional currency and 
              valuable “Radianite”, RUINS would have its own unique ties to this part of the lore. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on ancient temples and ruins of Cambodia, RUINS would be located in the 
              Cambodian jungle with architecture and foliage similar to what is seen in the real life inspiration.
